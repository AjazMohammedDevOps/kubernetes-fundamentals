## Creating a Deployment

A Deployment simply ensures that a specified number of pod “replicas” are running at any one time. If there are too many, it will kill some. If there are too few, it will start more.

File: vote-deployment.yaml

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: vote-dep
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: front
      app: vote
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: tier, operator: In, values: [front]}
  minReadySeconds: 20
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        stack: voting
        app: vote
        role: ui
        tier: front
        env: dev
        app: vote
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: schoolofdevops/vote
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: vote
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
      restartPolicy: Always
```

And save the file.

Now create the Deployment
```
kubectl create -f vote-deployment.yaml --record
```

Now the deployment is created. To check it,

```
kubectl get deployment
```
Sample Output
```
kubectl get deployments
NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
vote-dep   3         3         3            1           3m
```


##Scaling a deployment
To scale a deployment in Kubernetes is done by:

```
kubectl scale deployment/vote-dep --replicas=5
```

Sample output:
```
kubectl scale deployment/voting-appp --replicas=5
deployment "voting-appp" scaled
```


## Rolling updates with deployments

Update the version of the image in vote-deployment.yaml

```
...
        app: vote
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: schoolofdevops/vote:movies

```
