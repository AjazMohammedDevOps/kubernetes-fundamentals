## Creating a Deployment

A Deployment is a higher level abstraction which sits on top of replica sets and allows you to manage the way applications are deployed, rolled back at a controlled rate.

Features
  * Rollout a Replicaset
  * Deploy a new version : Creates a new replica set every time, moves pods from RS(n) to RS(n+1)
  * Rollback to previous RS  
  * Auto Scaling
  * Pause Deployments

File: vote_dep.yaml

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: vote-dep
  namespace: dev
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: front
      app: vote
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: tier, operator: In, values: [front]}
  minReadySeconds: 20
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: vote
        role: ui
        tier: front
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: schoolofdevops/vote
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: vote
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
      restartPolicy: Always
```

And save the file.

Now create the Deployment
```
kubectl apply -f vote_dep.yaml --record
```

Now the deployment is created. To check it,

```
kubectl rollout status deployment/vote-dep
kubectl get deployment
kubectl get rs
kubectl get pods --show-labels
```
Sample Output
```
kubectl get deployments
NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
vote-dep   3         3         3            1           3m
```


## Scaling a deployment  

To scale a deployment in Kubernetes:

```
kubectl scale deployment/vote-dep --replicas=5
```

Sample output:
```
kubectl scale deployment/vote-app --replicas=5
deployment "voting-appp" scaled
```


## Rolling updates with deployments

Update the version of the image in vote-deployment.yaml

File: vote_dep.yaml
```
...
        app: vote
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: schoolofdevops/vote:movies

```

Apply Changes and monitor the rollout

```
kubectl apply -f vote-deployment.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/vote-dep
```

## Rolling Back a Failed Update

Lets update the image to a tag which us non existant. We introduce this intentional error to fail fail the deployment.

File: vote-deployment.yaml
```
...
    app: vote
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: schoolofdevops/vote:movi

```

Do a new rollout and monitor

```
kubectl apply -f vote-deployment.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/vote-dep
```

Also watch the pod status which might look like

```
vote-dep-3040199436-sdq17   1/1       Running            0          9m
vote-dep-4086029260-0vjjb   0/1       ErrImagePull       0          16s
vote-dep-4086029260-zvgmd   0/1       ImagePullBackOff   0          15s
vote-rc-fsdsd               1/1       Running            0          27m
vote-rc-mcxs5               1/1       Running            0
```

To get the revision history and details  
```
kubectl rollout history deployment/vote-dep
kubectl rollout history deployment/vote-dep --revision=x
[replace x with the latest revision]
```

[Sample Output]

```
root@kube-01:~# kubectl rollout history deployment/vote-dep
deployments "vote-dep"
REVISION	CHANGE-CAUSE
1		kubectl scale deployment/vote-dep --replicas=5
3		<none>
6		<none>
7		<none>

root@kube-01:~# kubectl rollout history deployment/vote-dep --revision=7
deployments "vote-dep" with revision #7
Pod Template:
  Labels:	app=vote
	env=dev
	pod-template-hash=4086029260
	role=ui
	stack=voting
	tier=front
  Containers:
   vote:
    Image:	schoolofdevops/vote:movi
    Port:	80/TCP
    Environment:	<none>
    Mounts:	<none>
  Volumes:	<none>
```

To undo rollout,

```
kubectl rollout undo deployment/vote-dep
```

or

```
kubectl rollout undo deployment/vote-dep --to-revision=1
kubectl get rs
kubectl describe deployment vote-dep
```
