## Configmaps
Configmap is one of the ways to provide configurations to your application.

### Confgimap as Environment Variables
Create our configmap for vote app

```
vim apps/voting/dev/vote-configmap.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: vote
  namespace: dev
data:
  OPTION_A: EMACS
  OPTION_B: VI
```

In the above given configmap, we define two environment variables,
  1. OPTION_A=EMACS
  2. OPTION_B=VI

In order to use this configmap in the deployment, we need to reference it from the deployment file.
Check the deployment file for vote add for the following block.

file: `vote-deploy.yaml`

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: vote
  namespace: dev
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: front
      app: vote
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: tier, operator: In, values: [front]}
  minReadySeconds: 20
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: vote
        role: ui
        tier: front
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: schoolofdevops/vote
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: vote
        envFrom:
          - configMapRef:
              name: vote
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
      restartPolicy: Always
```

So when you create your deployment, these configurations will be made available to your application. In this example, the values defined in the configmap (EMACS and VI) will override the default values(CATS and DOGS) present in your source code.

### Configmap as a configuration file

In the last topic we have seen how to use configmap as environment variables. Now let us see how to use configmap as redis configuration file.

We have redis configuration as a file named `apps/voting/config/redis.conf`. We are going to convert this file into a configmap

```
Syntax:
  kubectl create configmap --from-file <CONF-FILE-PATH> <NAME-OF-CONFIGMAP>

kubectl create configmap --from-file apps/voting/config/redis.conf redis
```


Update your redis-deploy.yaml file to use this confimap.
File: `redis-deploy.yaml`

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis
  namespace: dev
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: back
      app: xxxx
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: tier, operator: In, values: [back]}
  minReadySeconds: 20
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: xxxx
        role: xxxx
        tier: back
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: xxxx
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: xxxx
        ports:
        - containerPort: xxxx
          protocol: TCP
        volumeMounts:
          - name: redis
            mountPath: /etc/redis.conf
            subPath: redis.conf
      volumes:
      - name: redis
        configMap:
          name: redis
      restartPolicy: Always
```

## Secrets

Secrets are for storing sensitive data like *passwords and keychains*. We will see how db deployment uses username and password in form of a secret.

To create secret for db,

```
vim apps/voting/dev/db-secret.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db
  namespace: dev
type: Opaque
data:
  POSTGRES_USER: YWRtaW4=
  # base64 of admin
  POSTGRES_PASSWD: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
  # base64 of password
```

As you can see, we cannot use the values directly. We will need to convert them into *base64* version and use it.

To create base64 encrypted strings, run

```
echo "admin" | base64
echo "password" | base64
```

If you do not have linux machines, you can make use of online base64 utility.

```
http://www.utilities-online.info/base64
```

Add this block of code under `container spec` of your db-deploy.yaml.

```
env:
  - name: POSTGRES_USER
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: db
        key: POSTGRES_USER
  - name: POSTGRES_PASSWD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: db
        key: POSTGRES_PASSWD
```
